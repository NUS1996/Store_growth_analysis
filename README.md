# Store_growth_analysis_excel

In this project, I am going to perform data analysis in Excel on a Richard Store dataset and share the insights on how the store can maximize growth. 
## The business questions that I will be asking myself are as follows: ##
* Compare the sales and order using a single chart. 
* Which month got the highest sales and orders?
* Who purchased more men or women in 2022?
* What are different status orders in 2022?
* List top 10 states contributing to sales. 
* Highest selling category?
* Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
