# Store_growth_analysis

In this project, I am going to perform data analysis on a Richard Store and share the insights on how the store can maximize growth. 
The business questions that I will be asking myself are as follows:
a.	Compare the sales and order using a single chart. 
b.	Which month got the highest sales and orders?
c.	Who purchased more men or women in 2022?
d.	What are different status orders in 2022?
e.	List top 10 states contributing to sales. 
f.	Highest selling category?
g.	Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?
